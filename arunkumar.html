        Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research was founded in 1984 as Bharath Institute of Science and
        Technology by S. Jagathrakshakan. It is among the first autonomous engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu.[5] It
        was
        first affiliated to Madras University followed by Anna University. The institute was awarded deemed
        university
        status in 2002 by the University Grants Commission in recognition of its academic excellence. Hence, the
        name
        was changed to Bharath Institute of Higher Education and Research. In September 2006, it was renamed as
        Bharath
        University per a decree issued by the University Grants Commission enabling deemed universities to include
        the
        word "university" in their names. In November 2017, it was again renamed as Bharath Institute of Higher
        Education and Research following a directive issued by University Grants Commission and an order by the
        Supreme
        Court of India to all the deemed universities in India
